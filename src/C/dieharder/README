## I | Generating a random file from otp generator ##
#####################################################

The file otp_prng.c contains the source code of a small program to generate
random file using otp generators.
To generate a file, you just need to compile the program using make and the
given makefile. Make sure to have openssl lib installed.

Once the program is compiled, you can execute it with a simple command line such
as : ./otp_prng 21F452EFCA3B 1000000
   where  - 21F452EFCA3B is a hexadecimal seed for the generator, representing a
                      key for an HOTP generator,
          - 1000000 is the number of 3 bytes block to generate,

The output of the program will be stored in a file called generated_bin. Do not
try to open this file since it contains random data which are not meant to be
human readable.

## II | Testing the randomness of generated values ##
#####################################################

The file created thanks to otp_prng can be used to test the randomness of the
otp generator. To do so, you can use any randomness testing tool.
We chose to use die harder testing suite. This common tool can be downloaded and
installed from your favorite linux distribution repositories.
          ex : yaourt -S dieharder (you must have enabled AUR repositories)

You can then launch a test with another simple command line such as :
    dieharder -a -g 201 -f generated_bin
 or dieharder -a -g 201 -f generated_bin -D default -D histogram -D description
    for more information.

Executed test are highly configurable. Please read dieharder man page to get a
description of all possible options.
